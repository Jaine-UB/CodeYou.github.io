                <p >This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a volunteer interest form where users can enter their personal information and indicate their available dates for volunteering. The submitted data is then processed with JavaScript and saved to a separate HTML file titled results.html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Jaine-UB/webdev-task-001">Build The Vocabulary List</a></li>
                <p>This project was created using HTML only. It takes a previously provided list of vocabulary terms and converts it into an unordered list, with each word and its definition displayed as a list item. All vocabulary terms are styled in bold to highlight them within the list.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Jaine-UB/jaine-ub.github.io">Creating Resume</a></li>
                <p> This project is my first HTML-based résumé page. It serves as an introductory showcase of my background, skills, and experience using foundational web development techniques.</p>
